This C# code leverages Dapper for object-relational mapping, Npgsql for PostgreSQL database connection, and OfficeOpenXml for creating Excel files, to perform the following operations:

1. **Database Connection**: It connects to two PostgreSQL databases using connection strings stored in `dbOne` and `dbTwo`.

2. **Data Querying**:
   - From the first database, it retrieves user details including user claims from tables `"User"` and `"UserClaims"`.
   - From the second database, it retrieves access permissions between users and sales persons from tables `user_sales_person_access` and `user_department`.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - It groups the retrieved user data by user ID, constructing a dictionary where each key is a user ID and each value is a list of `UserInfo` objects containing user details and claims.
   - For each user, it also identifies which sales persons they can view, creating `UserInfo` objects for each corresponding sales person.

4. **Excel File Creation**:
   - Using the OfficeOpenXml library, the code generates an Excel file containing a list of users with their full names, claims, and the sales persons they can view.
   - The data is formatted into columns with headers "User Id", "Full Name", "Claims", and "Sales Person", and the file is saved to a specified location on the user's desktop.

5. **Utility Classes**:
   - `UserInfo` class to represent details about users including their claims and the sales persons they can view.
   - `QueryUser` and `QuerySales` classes are used by Dapper to map the database query results to objects.
